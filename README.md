# Stock_price_prediction_IITkanpur
This Repo/project is made for Beat the market competetion  in Techkriti 2023 (IIT KANPUR).

This project is a Stock Price Prediction Model built using TensorFlow and NumPy. The model fetches stock price data from the Yahoo Finance API and uses it to predict future stock prices.

## Features
- Fetches real-time stock data from the Yahoo Finance API.
- Implements a deep learning model using TensorFlow for predicting stock prices.
- Provides visualizations of stock prices and predictions.

## Results 
- Used HDFC Bank Limited (HDB) data for trainig and testing of model.
- Used 80% data for Training and 20% data for Testing.
